# XJS Remote Example
For further documentation, please see https://xjsframework.github.io/tutorials.html#/remotexjs

# Usage
- Run `npm install` and then `npm start` from the `server` directory to run the socket/communication server
- Add /extension/Proxy.html as an extension in XSplit Broadcaster and then make sure it's open/running
- Open `index.html` in your browser

You should now be able to see the scene name updating as you change scene in XSplit Broadcaster. Any normal XJS call can be made from index.html and will be sent through the proxy.
